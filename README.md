**Simple White** is a cross-platform Firefox theme that aims to simplify Firefox's appearance. With simplified color scheme and translucent tabs, Simple White delivers a clean and delightful experience of using Firefox. The theme is also hosted on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/simplewhite/).

## Packaging

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Pack all the files using `zip -qr9XD simplewhite.xpi *`

Then, you can open `simplewhite.xpi` in Firefox and follow the installation procedure.

## Releases

Pre-packaged releases by me can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/lychichem/simplewhite/releases).
